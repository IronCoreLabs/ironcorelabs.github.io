**BOZEMAN, Montana, and BOULDER, Colorado -- May 18, 2017 --** IronCore Labs, Inc., a Colorado and Montana-based developer of customer-controlled data for SaaS companies, announced today the closing of a $1.5 million seed round of funding.  The financing was led by Next Frontier Capital with participation from Blue Note Ventures, PV Ventures, v1.vc, and several private investors.

"We are thrilled to have these great venture firms and private investors join us as partners in this journey," said Patrick Walsh, CEO of IronCore.

Customer-controlled data can give companies the security and privacy they get with on-prem software, while still enjoying the flexibility and cost-savings of the cloud."

IronCore also announced today that Richard Harjes is joining the Board of Directors.  Richard is a General Partner at Bozeman-based Next Frontier Capital and brings decades of experience in finance and innovation to the team. "We are excited to be an early investor in IronCore," said Richard. "They sit at the intersection of data security, Enterprise software, and the shift to the cloud, which represents an enormous opportunity. We believe IronCore is well positioned to become the foundation for the next generation of Enterprise cloud applications."

The company will use its current funding to launch its solution publicly and to fulfill its mission to make the world a safer place to do digital business.

## About IronCore Labs, Inc.

With offices in Bozeman, MT and Boulder, CO, IronCore Labs helps cloud software companies sell to the Enterprise by reducing barriers around security and compliance.

IronCore makes it easy for application developers to invert control of sensitive data. Normally, application vendors manage the keys that encrypt such data, but IronCore’s customer-controlled data service shifts control of those keys to the owner of the data.

Enterprises prefer this approach because they can store sensitive data in the cloud without loss of security or control, and SaaS vendors get to sell more software, faster.
