---

**BOZEMAN, Montana -- September 23, 2016 --** IronCore Labs, Inc. won the Montana Pitch Fest Thursday night in a contest with seven other high-tech start-up companies presenting their ideas to investors and venture capitalists. The event was sponsored by the Rocky Mountain Venture Capital Association (RMVCA) and held at the Jake Jabs College of Business and Entrepreneurship on the campus of Montana State University in Bozeman. Jake Jabs attended.

"IronCore Labs is creating the next generation of security for enterprise applications," said Patrick  Walsh, IronCore Labs CEO , who pitched the company's innovative data security solution at the event. "The news brings daily reports of security breaches where personal information has been hacked and stolen, but IronCore Labs’ model secures each individual piece of data, giving control over access to the data to the person that owns it," Walsh said.

IronCore Labs won a stipend for travel expenses to present a full pitch to the venture capitalist of its choice. The company tied for first place with Submittable of Missoula.

Companies applied to RMVCA to present at Pitch Fest and those selected introduced their innovations in six-minute presentations akin to the fast-paced ‘Shark Tank’ show, before an audience and a panel of visiting venture capitalists. Panelists included principals from Colorado-based Access Venture Partners, Blue Note Ventures, and Cooley LLP; Epic Ventures and Sorenson Capital of Utah; Arizona-based Grayhawk Capital; Next Frontier Capital, Montana; and Sun Mountain Capital of New Mexico.
