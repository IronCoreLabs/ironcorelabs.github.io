We have left behind the comforts of salaried positions and known quantities and embarked on an exploration of the unknown.  Here's what we do know: things are moving fast and so far so good.  We're here to take on the status quo and change the way business applications in the cloud are built together with the demands and expectations of customers.  We have a large vision and on Day 6 it is already time enough to reflect on a fruitful week.

Stay tuned for details on the vision and our progress.
